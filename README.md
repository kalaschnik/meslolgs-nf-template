## Meslo History

Meslo LG is based upon [Apple's Menlo (v6.1d8e1)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menlo_(typeface)) and contains vertical metric changes (affecting line spacing) and changes to single glyphs like the asterisk. The idea behind Meslo LG fonts is to allow the user to have some control over vertical spacing by choosing one of three planned variants (small, medium and large). **LG** in this case stands for **Line Gap**. Apple's Menlo is based upon the Open Source font Bitstream Vera and the public domain font Deja Vu.

### Menlo (_Jim Lyles_, August 2009)

Menlo is a monospaced sans-serif typeface designed by Jim Lyles. The face first shipped with Mac OS X Snow Leopard. Menlo is based upon the open source font Bitstream Vera and the public domain font DejaVu.

### Meslo LG (_André Berg_, March 2010)

In March 2010 André Berg created Meslo LG with the intension:
> I really like Menlo but I do have my nitpicky gripes with it:
> - The default vertical (line) spacing is just way to cramped for me, and also
> - I am not particularily fond of the horizontal baseline alignment of the asterisk.  
> 
> That’s why I decided to customize Menlo, regarding these “issues”...

### Meslo LG Nerd Fonts (_Ryan L McIntyre_, April 2015)

The Nerd Fonts (NF) project (https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts) adds over 3.000 icons to popular coding fonts.
Those are extra glyphs from _“popular 'iconic fonts' such as Font Awesome, Devicons, Octicons, and others.”_

Meslo LG S/M/L was included in the nerd fonts project giving birth for _Meslo LG S/M/L Nerd Font_.


### MesloLGS-NFPL (_Roman Perepelitsa_, 2020)

To account very precicse glyph composition, Perepelitsa further tweaked the S variant of Meslo LG Nerd Font ([details](https://github.com/romkatv/nerd-fonts/commits/master).
